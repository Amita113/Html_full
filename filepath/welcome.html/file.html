<!-- how we access the folder that is present in the root directory. The root directory is the topmost directory that contains all related files and folders.


The relative file path describes the path of the file relative to the location of the current web page.

In the  example, images/hill.jpg is the relative path. We are able to access the images folder because the images directory is located in the same folder as our HTML file (index.html).


: It shows the path of the file present in the same folder of the current web page file.
